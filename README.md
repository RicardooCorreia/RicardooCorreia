# Hey!
## 👨‍💻 About me
I'm a passionate software engineer driven to create clean and efficient software, finding great gratification in high-quality development.  
I love to talk about software, sharing and receiving knowledge, and continuously learning about the art of clean coding and architecture.  
My main goal with any project is to give my best, always trying to exceed expectations, as I find that this is the best way to evolve both the product and myself. With this mentality, I'm always able to see and feel my impact on a project.

## 💻 What I'm currently doing
